# DIP-Project-Identify-Whiteflies-on-Crop-Leaves

In this project we have followed the digital image processing methods outlined in the research paper called "Using digital image processing for counting whiteflies on soybean leaves " to identify and count different stages of white flies on crop leaves.

The Whitefly is a type of airborne insect that harm various types of crops like soybean, bean, cassava by feeding on plant sap which causes them to fall off. The following image shows the lifecycle of the whitefly.

Since whiteflies have different characteristics in different stages of their lifecycle. We can use digital image processing methods to idenfity and count whiteflies at various stages.

## The methods outlined in the research paper
There are two methods outlined.
1. Simple Color Transformation  
2. Chaining Color Transformations
